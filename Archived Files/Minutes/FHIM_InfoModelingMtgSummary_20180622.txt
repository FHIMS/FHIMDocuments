
The Problem:

We want to reference other "sub-observations" within a "primary" observation.  "Sub-Observations" may or may not be stand-alone observations. 

CIMI EvaluationResult has a "precondition", which can be a finding, procedure, etc. It's really a co-occuring "finding", but SCT calls it precondition

FHIR has a "component" observation, which are not stand-alone


3150-0   Inhaled oxygen concentration
3151-8   Inhaled oxygen flow rate
Breathing room air (finding) SCTID: 722742002


Some observations have multiple component observations. These component observations are expressed as separate code value pairs that share the same attributes. Examples include systolic and diastolic component observations for blood pressure measurement and multiple component observations for genetics observations.

Component observations share the same attributes in the Observation resource as the primary observation and are always treated a part of a single observation (they are not separable). However, the reference range for the primary observation value is not inherited by the component values and is required when appropriate for each component observation.
